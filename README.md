# Garbage Pail Kids Images

## What

Garbage pail kids cards was a huge fad in the 1980s and I was a part of that fad with my collection and love for the trading cards. I have so many memories with these little things and amazing artwork by mostly John Pound and Tom Bunk. I sold my collection, but wanted to have a complete set of images on my hard drive so I scraped certain websites

A series of simple scrapers to scrape certain websites images so people can enjoy these files on their desktops as opposed to clicking through a slideshow.

## Why

Finally collect the complete sets without spending any money. Just git clone the repo!

## Todo

- [ ] Scrape The various themed folders
- [ ] I dont really want to scrape the backs, they are all named funny and not consistent.

## Contributing

I would love to see if someone can scrape backs from somewhere and contribute a scraper in any language.
